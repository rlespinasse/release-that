# Release That

> An opinionated GitHub Action to ease the release of a repository using semantic versioning

Minimal setup to enable semantic release on any repository

- **Step 1:** Add the  following content inside `.github/workflows/release-that.yaml` file

  ```yaml
  name: Release that
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    release-that:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout sources
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Release That
          uses: rlespinasse/release-that@v1
  ```

- **Step 2:** Enjoy your automatic release system

## Inputs

### `dry-run`

Whether to make a release in `dry-run` mode. The outputs act like a release was published.

```yaml
- uses: rlespinasse/release-that@v1
  with:
    dry-run: true
```

### `without-prefix`

Remove prefix from released version, like `v1.0.0` -> `1.0.0` (doesn't apply to major tag)

```yaml
- uses: rlespinasse/release-that@v1
  with:
    without-prefix: true
```

### `major-tag`

Activate the publication a major tag based on released version. Possible values `true`, `false`, and `auto`.
If this tag already exists, it will be overwritten.

```yaml
- uses: rlespinasse/release-that@v1
  with:
    major-tag: true
```

By default, the value is `auto` to activate it (like `true`) on some conditions, otherwise, it's skip (like `false`).

- the repository is a [GitHub action due to metadata file presence][metadata-file] `action.yml` or `action.yaml` (to follow [GitHub action recommandation][action-versionning])
- _do not hesitate to propose the next condition through issue or pull-request_

### `github-token`

Whether to use a Personal Access Token instead of the default GitHub Token for release

```yaml
- uses: rlespinasse/release-that@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

By default `${{ github.token }}` is used to make a release.
[Due to limitation for security concerns][token-security], if you want to build a workflows that react when a new release is made, you must use a Personal Access Token.

## Outputs

- major_tag_published: Whether a major tag was published (`true` or `false`)
- major_tag: Value of the published major tag, otherwise empty (e.g. `v1`)

And the following outputs from [cycjimmy/semantic-release-action][semantic-release] (see `Under the wood` section).

- new_release_published: Whether a new release was published (`true` or `false`)
- new_release_version: Version of the new release. (e.g. `1.3.0`)
- new_release_major_version: Major version of the new release. (e.g. `1`)
- new_release_minor_version: Minor version of the new release. (e.g. `3`)
- new_release_patch_version: Patch version of the new release. (e.g. `0`)
- last_release_version: Version of the previous release, if there was one. (e.g. `1.2.0`)

## Under the wood

This is a wrapper around [cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2][semantic-release] action with

- No mandatory configuration like `package.json` or `.releaserc` files
- Support of [Default branches][default-branches]
  - with the addition of `vN.x` kind of branches
- Auto-publication of a GitHub release with changelog based on the commit history

In a near future, the `release-that` action will support more release system with an opinionated way of doing it.
